### 2.1.1

>"Interactivity's promise is that the experience of culture can be something that you do rather than something you are given. This complicates our conventional ideas about 'content' in the context of this new medium.''
>â€”[Rokeby%20ConstructionofExperience.pdf](https://www.sfu.ca/~jtoal/papers/Rokeby%20ConstructionofExperience.pdf)

>"He stresses that content in interactive media be seen not only as the subject matter of what is shown (through visual or other media), but also that the interface itself be recognized as content, since "by defining how we perceive and navigate content, [the interface] shapes our experience of that content. If culture, in the context of interactive media, becomes something we 'do' it's the interface that defines how we do it and how the 'doing' feels."

>"Rokeby then continues to list different implications of creating such interfaces, such as the social responsibility of creating interactive interfaces: while in an artistic work, illusion is acceptable, in a commercial world this becomes deception.

### 2.1.2. Dialogue, Control, and Choice

>... once the visitor feels she is in control of the system, there is no possibility anymore for dialogue.[^1]

>For interactive works, the artist has to second-guess the recipient: how will the recipient behave in the interaction with the artwork to complete it?

"A possible other approach for the artist is to ==consider the point of view of the work itself==: how does it perceive the world and how can it act upon the world?"
>This way the work becomes a momentary but dynamic reflection of a thinking process. Because the artist does not write the viewer's side of the interaction, the viewer can respond in a more open way.[^1]
