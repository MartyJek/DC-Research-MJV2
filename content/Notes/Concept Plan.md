# Introduction

	![[Untitled_Artwork.jpg]]

>*"Unlike Simondon’s techno-aesthetics, which may eventually iteratively find a pleasing equilibrium between functional technique and aesthetics, permacomputing’s techno-aesthetics are much more perilous because ==a third component is forced in: an informed and contextualised intention to address the social, cultural, environmental and economic externalities of maximalist computer and network technologies==."*
>- Mansoux et. al: [[Permacomputing Aesthetics]]

## Research Question

### V1

>How can I ~~define~~ **explore** a biosphere-aware techno-aesthetics in computer graphics within permacomputing design principles?

___
### V2

>How can I explore eco-consciousness in computer graphics based on Permacomputing design principles?

___
### V3

- Adding interactivity

>**How can I explore and make aware of eco-conscious digital aesthetics in an interactive media installation based on [[On Permacomputing#PMC Principles x Computer Graphics|Permacomputing design principles]]** ?


#### V3.1

>How can I explore and make aware of sustainable approaches in digital media through an interactive media installation?

#### V3.2

>How can I explore and make aware of sustainable approaches in computer graphics and media streaming through an interactive media installation?


___ 
# Goal of the Project

- **Make aware of and expose**

	- energy use in media streaming (and computer graphics)
		- **through** the interactivity in the piece
			- e.g. attaching a Wattmeter in each computational component of the installation 
		
	- the overarching system of ICT maximalisation
		- **through** the content of the medium being displayed
