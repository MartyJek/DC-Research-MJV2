# Permacomputing 2020

**Source:**<br>[Permacomputing | viznut](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing.html)
### 1. Problem

- Overconsumption of (artificial) energy = Progress
	- wastefulness

- Failing their expectations
	- scale down resource requirements
	- make the world more complex than less
	- slower instead of faster

>[[Content Consuming Devices#We don’t have computers anymore. We have content consuming devices.|Instead of amplifying the users' intelligence, they rather amplify their stupidity]]


#### 1.5 Solution
**Let nature do the work, finding solutions in problems**

>In both computing and agriculture, a major issue is that problems are too often "solved" by increasing controllability and resource use. ==Permaculture takes another way, advocating methods that "let nature do the work"== and thus minimize the dependence on artificial energy input.

>it trusts in human ingenunity in finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition into co-operation, waste into resources.

### 2.0 Physical Resources

#### 2.1 Energy

- resource-sensitivity
	- adapting to changes in energy conditions
	- using the available energy wisely

>the computer is aware of the state of the surrounding energy system.

Storing energy:
>[Flywheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage) are a potential alternative to chemical batteries.

#### 2.2 Silicon

>Instead of planned obsolescence, there should be planned longevity.

>[Alternatives to semiconductors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing) should be actively researched. [Living cells](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328395242_Towards_fungal_computer) might be able to replace microchips in some tasks sometime in the future.



### 3.0 Observation and Interaction

>…bidirectional and co-operative relationship with natural systems: you should not expect your garden to be easily top-down controllable like an army unit but accept its quirkiness and adapt to it.

**Observation** is among the most important human skills computers can augment. Things that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe can be brought within human cognitive capacity by various computational processes.

>In Bill Mollison's words, "Information is _the_ critical potential resource. It becomes a resource only when obtained and acted upon."

Computer systems should also make their own inner workings as observable as possible. If the computer produces visual output, it would use a fraction of its resources to visualize its own intro- and extrospection

#### 3.2 [[Yin and Yang hacking]]

>The difference between yin and yang hacking is similar to the difference between permaculture and industrial agriculture. In the latter, a piece of nature (the field) is forced (via a huge energy investment) into an oversimplified state that is as predictable and controllable as possible. Permaculture, on the other hand, emphasizes a co-operative (observing and interacting) relationship with the natural system.

### 4.0 Progress

>The linear-progressivist idea of technological obsolescence may stem from authoritarian metaphors: there may only be one king at a time. This idea easily leads to an impoverished and monocultural view of technology where there is room for only a handful of ideas at a time.

Instead of technological "progress" (that implies constant abandoning of the old), we should consider expanding the diversity and abundance of ideas. Different kinds of technology should be seen as supporting each other rather than competing against each other for domination.

In nature, everything is interdependent, and these interdependencies tend to strengthen the whole. In technology, however, large dependency networks and "diversity of options" often make the system more fragile. Civilization should therefore try to find ways of making technological dependencies work more like those in nature, as well as ways of embracing technological diversity in fruitful ways.

### 7. Culture

#### 7.1. Relationship with technology

Any community that uses a technology should develop a [deep relationship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_and_the_Character_of_Contemporary_Life) to it. Instead of being framed for specific applications, the technology would be allowed to freely connect and grow roots to all kinds of areas of human and non-human life. Nothing is "just a tool" or "just a toy", nobody is "just a user".

### 7.3. Audiovisual media

Many people prefer to consume their audiovisual media at resolutions and data rates that are as high as possible (thus consuming as much energy as possible). This is, of course, an extremely unsustainable preference.

There are countless ways, most of them still undiscovered, to make low and moderate data complexities look good — sometimes good enough that increased resolution would no longer improve them. Even compression artifacts might look so pleasant that people would actually prefer to have them.

[[For extreme realism, perfection, detail and sharpness, people would prefer to look at nature.]]
#### On Displays

>Whenever bright external light is available, displays should be able to use it instead of competing against it with their own backlight. (See: [Transflective LCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display))

# Permacomputing Update (2021)

**Source:**<br>[Permacomputing Update 2021 | viznut](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/permacomputing_update_2021.html)

### 6.0 Permacomputing Practice

>I have been reluctant to name specific technologies or design constraints for permacomputing. This is because I want to support a diverse polyculture of ideas and possibilities. Asking what is the most suitable programming language for permacomputing is a bit like asking what is the most suitable plant for permaculture – the entire question contradicts itself.

>I have noticed that many "sustainable" or even "low-tech" computing projects have been built on cheap DIY-oriented boards such as Raspberry Pi. Even though these may be among the best of the currently available options, it should be noted that they have been designed for hackability and replaceability rather than longevity or repairability.

#### 6.1 Low Complexity

One possible approach to simplicity is to try to keep things simple enough that they can be thoroughly understood and (re)implemented by one person. This applies not only to application programs but the dependent elements as well (programming language, operating system, firmware, hardware). This is not to say that people should write everything from scratch but to keep the complexity human-graspable. The ideal of human-sized computing is particularly applicable to systems that are used as tools (because tools in general should be thoroughly understandable to their users)

One way to deal with huge platforms is to create "pockets of simplicity" such as [simple virtual machines](https://100r.co/site/uxn.html) that can also run on bare hardware. Emulators of existing hardware platforms are a special case of this. VMs are particularly suitable for small things that require far less computation than what the hardware is capable of. A virtual machine may also help eliminate compatibility problems and code rot, if it is unambiguously defined and the definition is canonized (permanently frozen).

 >in order to actually create something that represents permacomputing, one needs to make a lot of specific design decisions.


# Maximalism and Virtualism

**Source:**<br>[Maximalism and Virtualism | viznut](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/maximalism_virtualism.html)
___

**Max**

>In computational esthetics, **Maximalism** manifests itself especially as the estheticisation of size and abundance. For example, images contain more and more pixels, colors and details, which require more and more capacity for storage and computation. Even when a technological invention allows us to do more with less - for example, by better video compression codecs - this invention is used, in line with [Jevons paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox), to accelerate quantitative growth - doing more with more.

>In everyday computing, Maximalism is concretely reflected in the way in which, for example, the content shared on social media is bloating up. Images attract more attention than text alone, and video clips attract more attention than still images. The service may even reward those who prefer to share videos – perhaps because video-watching is considered addictive. So even social media platforms are competing at whose service is the most maximalist.

>Maximalism is often connectede to the pursuit of photorealism, for example in video game graphics. Photorealism is a relatively unimaginative goal - everyone knows what reality looks like - and at the same time impossible: the sharp-eyed will learn to distinguish even the most faithful imitations from the real thing. This makes it convenient for the market: it is easy to make the "current generation" of reality-imitation look outdated by contrasting it to the "next generation", and this contrast also serves as a way to sell new microchips and devices.

>Maximalism and planned obsolescence feed each other. When technologies from different 'generations' can be reduced to one-dimensional numbers, where bigger is always unequivocally better in every way, there is no justification for the existence of the old and it is easy to throw it into the waste heap. 4K is replaced by 8K, 4G is replaced by 5G. Despite the fact that there is already an unimaginable abundance of resources, this abundance shows up as temporary and inadequate.

**Virt**

'Virtualism' means here a way of thinking in which hiding and disguising the complexity of a system, or its inner workings in general, is self-serving and extreme. Details that the user 'doesn't need to see' are considered dirty and ugly, something that need to be hidden from them even when they might actually be relevant. For example, the user of a smartphone application may not even be given the opportunity to know which of the files they are using are stored on the device itself and which are on an external server. Virtualism also extends to the physical appearance of the phone - its monolithic design and lack of moving parts keep its internal workings as hidden as possible from the user.

>In digital esthetics, Maximalism and Virtualism support each other. Virtualism seeks to obscure the fact that an image is made up of pixels, and this is best achieved by maximizing the pixel density. The ideal is a completely mirror-like, undisturbed and noiseless communication channel, whose existence, let alone its characteristics, cannot be detected at all

**the Cloud**

Virtualism also appears in IT metaphors. For example, the word 'cloud' refers to large, energy-hungry computer rooms that rent storage and computing capacity to customers, commoditized so that they don't have to worry about physical servers. The word "cloud" summons images that are as far away as possible from concrete computer hardware consisting of separable parts. It is something homogeneous, gaseous and ever-changing, something that is pointless to even try to compartmentalize in one's mind, but which, on the other hand, brings peace of mind as it floats against a blue background.

>Above all, Virtualism causes alienation. People become alienated not only from the technology they are using and its tangible material framework, but also from reality in general and even from themselves.



# Digital Aesthetics, environmental change and the subcultures of computer art

**Source:**<br>
___
### Abstract 

For decades, the development of information technology has been characterized by a very strong ==growth orientation, which is now coming to an end with the fading of Moore's Law and environmental change.== Academic research in computing has only recently begun to wake up to the fact that there are limits to growth, and that a more fundamental paradigm shift is required to achieve sustainable computing; mere technical tinkering is not enough. Growth-centricity has also dictated the development of digital esthetics, which will thus need to change as well. I suggest that the guidelines for this change should be sought in subcultures of computer art whose esthetic ideals are very different from the mainstream Maximalism and Virtualism – the self-serving glorification of the big and plentiful and the hiding of the technical basis of things. I have chosen demo art, chip music, pixel graphics and glitch art as examples of these subcultures. The ideals of "digitality" are also being challenged by post-digitality, so I will also look at these subcultures through this concept. I will conclude with reflections on the possible impacts of environmental change on digital esthetics and computing more generally, and on the ways in which computer art subcultures could play a pioneering role in these developments.

- growth orientation -> degrowth orientation

### 1.

>digital esthetics, it manifests itself in particular as **Maximalism**, which glorifies a maximally data-intensive representation of reality – for example, the highest possible resolution of video content and the photorealism ideal of game graphics.

### 2. 

>Whenever a technical invention enables more to be done with less, it is used to accelerate the quantitative growth more to do more with more. This phenomenon is called the Jevons paradox

#### 2.1 Maximalism

>In everyday computing, the Maximalist esthetic is often associated with the pursuit of the most accurate, sharp and realistic image possible, for example in games or video content. This is a relatively unimaginative goal - everyone knows what reality looks like – and at the same time impossible: the sharpeyed will learn to distinguish even the most faithful imitations from the real thing.

#### 2.2 Virtualism

>Even the physical nature of the phone is Virtualist – its monolithic nature and lack of moving parts keep its internal structure as hidden from the user as possible. Revealing hidden layers of virtualism through Glitch art:
>Rosa Menkman (2011, 13-14), the ideal of perfect, mirror-like, noise-free data transmission is a kind of holy grail that can be approached indefinitely but never reached. Glitch art, practiced by Menkman, critiques this ideal by highlighting the glitches and errors, thus also revealing hidden layers of abstraction.
