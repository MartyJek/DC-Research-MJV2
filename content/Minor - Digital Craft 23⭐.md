# Research

- contextualisation of your project, positioning
  critically exploring technologies and their contexts,
  substantiating your concept with references (to position yourself towards
  technology.

- research through making
  Experimenting, prototyping, working with research methods from a critical
  perspective

- interactions with participants, story sharing, testing, insights
- documenting, reflecting, analysing

## classes, deadlines, assignment

The research tutorials will take place on **Thursday afternoons, 13.00 – 15.30.**

==**DEADLINES:**==

==DRAFT==: Friday November 17, 2023, please send by email to: [d.m.herst@hr.nl](mailto:d.m.herst@hr.nl)

==FINAL:== Friday  December 15, 2023, 6 PM, please upload your document in Osiris.

#### October/November: making as research: reflect on practice

- exploring /experimenting (materials, technologies, systems, formats,
  aesthetics)
- identifying your core methods
- documenting experiments, steps, iterations
- reflection upon methods and results.
- interacting with audiences (input, testing)

#### December: finalizing

**RESEARCH DOCUMENT: research by making**

**aim**  
The aim of the research document is to contextualise and substantiate your research process behind your project. You show and discuss its contexts, your methods, experiments, your insights/findings and your conclusions. Compiling this research document also prepares you for your graduation.

**approach**  
During the sessions, we will discuss your research process, findings and analyses as well as the connection with your project. We will discuss your references (theoretical contexts), artistic research approaches/ methods, experiments (visual, material, sensory etc) and ways of documenting your research.

**components**  
Your research document clarifies and substantiates your research process: interpreting references and inspirations, working with certain methods and approaches, showing visual/material/spatial and other experimentation and iteration, analysing the outcomes and communicating a conclusion, including a reflection on the relation to your project.  
Give insights in your process: why you took certain steps and made decisions, based on which observations, insights and reflections. Explain and reflect your role within the collaboration.  Do not only write down WHAT you did, but also include WHY you made certain steps and decisions. Make sure you include relevant visuals of your process and clearly describe them.

**Your research document must include:**

- title, table of contents, name, student number and date;
- a report of your research in text, image, video, and/or audio of approximately 3000-5000 words words or equivalent; excluding reading list, appendices and footnotes. (possibilities to be discussed with research tutors)
- Clearly defined research question and conclusion
- Explanation of the relationship between your research and your practical work, these together form your final project;
- a reflection on the process, iterations, decisions and the results through the lens of bias and/or power
- a literature and reference list (min. 5). Use references in MLA style – refer to (at least some of) the texts, films, works etc that have been discussed in the course + use your own references.
- Include extract of (at least) one interview with an external partner

**Circle of doing Research**

We will discuss the Circle of doing research and see how/if it is applicable to your research process.

**ASSESSMENT**

**Assessment criteria**  
– You formulate a clearly defined research question that suits Digital Craft.

– You use relevant sources (min. 5 texts) and research of other experts.

– You reflect critically on core concepts, methods and theories in relation to your research question and your professional context

– You experiment, test ideas and materials for the development and realization of your concept.

You reflect critically on the results and the chosen research methods.

– You independently carry out a research cycle with a clear thread of inquiry, design, reflection and conclusion.

– You communicate the process and the results of your research in a structured and traceable way

## themes

Perspective: current technologies and

- Bias: encoded bias in algorithms/machine learning
- Bias/criticism towards new technologies
- Power: Political power/ ownership shaping (non)human behaviour

Questioning ownership and power of systems that shape technologies. Who owns the system? What is the context?

## Key Questions

How can we turn the steering wheel to another angle to create <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">other futures</mark>?

How can art allow us to reflect, process and reshape the <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">relation between technology, (non)humans, society, and the planet</mark>?

What is <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">our role and responsibility </mark>in such a digital age?

What <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">autonomy</mark> do we have?

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">What does autonomy mean</mark> in these technological systems?

## Critical Reading: What a Text Says, Does, and Means

How can we identify the value of text in times of information overload
and fake news? Who is speaking, from which perspective, for which
audience?

A text is never ‘neutral’ but reflects the perspective of an author.
We will analyse texts, discuss the content, author’s position and
argumentation and relevance for your project.

autopsy of the text

– What a text says: the message and content
– What a text does: the author’s aim of the text (statement, appealing
for sympathy, starting a debate etc.)

– What a text means: interpretation (analysis, meaning of the text as a
whole in a certain context)

http://www.criticalreading.com/critical_reading.htm

– deep understanding of the text:
what does the author say and mean?

– recognizing different perspectives:
from which perspective, who is the author, what is the aim?

– critical reflection, questioning the text:
which questions do you have regarding the text?

- relating to the text for your own argumentation:
- which authors do I relate to, arguments and counter arguments
