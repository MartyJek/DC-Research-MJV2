# Abstract

>We understand the provocation of "new filmic geographies" in two ways: as [[media geopolitics]], explored in the first part by Laura, and as [[media geopoetics]], explored in the second part by Radek. Our contributions are united by disdain for the ideology of unlimited media access and admiration for the artists and hackers who transform limited tech nical means into social and aesthetic abundance.[^1]


# New Filmic Geographies

>"New filmic geographies" — invites us to celebrate audiences' increased capacity to access movies independent of their geographical location, thanks to streaming video. Doubtless this is a cosmopolitan and, to some degree, decolonizing development in cinema distribution, helping filmmakers find their audiences all over the world and connecting viewers to movies once obtainable only by the most determined efforts.


# Streaming Media and Bandwidth Imperialism

## Data-Rich vs. Data-Poor

>The terms data-rich and -poor derive from environmental scientists Mathias Leidig and Richard M. Teeuw, who calculate the global digital divide, country by country, based on these variables: internet speed; hardware (number of computers per household); mobile phone subscriptions; mobile network coverage; internet users as percentage of population; and participation in higher education

## Streaming = Bad

>The high turnover of mobile phones, whose production is electricity intensive, also contributes significantly to this footprint. Some researchers project that by 2030 — the year by which we must have cut emissions to 70% of 2005 levels in order to forestall catastrophic overheating of our planet[2](https://post45.org/2021/04/bandwidth-imperialism-and-small-file-media/#footnote_1_14915) — streaming will be responsible for 7% of global GHG.[3](https://post45.org/2021/04/bandwidth-imperialism-and-small-file-media/#footnote_2_14915) And this is one of the more modest calculations. **Our informative and pleasurable media access is literally setting Earth on fire.**



## Fast internet = Bad

>We dispute the necessity of fast internet, which is wasted on indulgences like indentureship to the internet of things, mostly useless innovations in electricity-devouring artificial intelligence, the climate crime that is Bitcoin, and high-resolution streaming movies on demand.


## Streaming carbon footprint = ???

>Streaming overrides national boundaries in quite physical ways. To calculate the carbon footprint of streaming media in a given region, **we need to look at the source of electricity in that region, and also of the locations of data centers and networks outside the region through which streaming data passes**

==*Calculating the Carbon footprint of streaming media is hard, as everything is being obfuscated by the Cloud*==


## Digital Neo-Colonialism

>Ramon Lobato suggests that the ideal of net neutrality — that all citizens should have equal access to high-speed internet — is "a vision that can never scale meaningfully in a global sense. It is grounded in a first-world idea of the internet, premised on an assumption of unbounded capacity. It does not ring true with how the internet is experienced in many countries.
>
>**It is bandwidth imperialism to assume that other regions even want American-style, bingeable HD streaming.**
