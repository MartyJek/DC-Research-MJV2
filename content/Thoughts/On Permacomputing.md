# Transitioning into postdigital techno-aesthetics

#postdigital #eco-consciousness #techno-aesthetics 

Coming from a computational extractive background that features playing around with the newest technological tools (e.g. photorealism, physics simulation in 3D; anything-AI) the transitioning from the world of [[The trap of mesmerizing aesthetics|mesmerizing aesthetics]] into <u>mindful aesthetics</u> proves difficult. 

While trying to figure out in what way(s) I can shift my direction (or attention?) I've come to understand that a radical switch to a Permacomputing (PMC) framework is possible <u>but hardly sensible.</u>

1. I do already own computationally powerful tools as my dispose, so why not use them?
	- I do not have to use their maximum performance, except in rare occasions
	- Using powerful equipment for projects with medium-low computational requirements leads to a longer longevity (source?)

2. My previous practices I've build on and the time used for said practices would possibly become obsolete, I feel not ready to start from scratch.

To be able to play with PMC principles and not land in a pit of inaction I want to introduce a [[Permacomputing Spectrum]].

___
## 'Hard vs. 'Soft' Permacomputing

aka. [[Permacomputing Spectrum]]

___

# PMC Principles x Computer Graphics

>Which [[Permacomputing#Design Principles|Permacomputing principles]] intersect with the [[Ecomedia|sustainable use]] of Computer Graphics?

#### Care for Life

>aka. general (biosphere-) awareness

- What is the basis of your design work? Do you follow the mainstream tendencies of maximalist aesthetics? Why? Is the act of following those tendencies not also engaging in extractivist practices for the sake of profit?  

#### Care for the Chips

- Maximising hardware longevity by minimising required computing power
- Utilising obsolete hardware; repairing/repurposing e-waste

#### Keep it small

> [[Small File Media Festival]]

- low complexity/ small systems are beautiful

#### Keep it flexible

- by using open-source hardware

#### Amplify Awareness + Expose everything

> [[Content Consuming Devices#We don’t have computers anymore. We have content consuming devices.| We don’t have computers anymore. We have content consuming devices ]]

- How can I make aware of mindful computing through my art?
- In what ways can I expose evil maximalist tendencies of ICT culture?
